Humanities\nOxford is at the forefront of international research in the humanities, with five subject areas judged to have the highest volume of world-leading 4*-rated research in the UK in the 2021 Research Excellence Framework.\nThe Humanities Division comprises around a third of the University's community of staff and students, offering taught graduate and research degrees in a very wide range of subjects. [Humanities departments and faculties](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department?division=humanities) attract outstanding students, academics and researchers from across the globe. As a result, graduate students have the opportunity to undertake their studies and research in a stimulating, challenging and highly rewarding intellectual environment.\nSome of these subjects are relatively new, and cross the boundaries of traditional disciplines. Others are areas of academic research that have long been recognised as of central importance, and they include some that few other universities are still able to support. In each case, the objective is to sustain and to teach the highest standards of scholarship. The dynamism of intellectual activity is in evidence in the wide variety of open lectures and seminars, in addition to those for specific courses.\n[View all courses](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing?keywords=%2A%2AHumanities%2A%2A) [View taught courses](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing?keywords=%2A%2AHumanities%2A%2A&field_graduate_course_type_tid=5359) [View research courses](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing?keywords=%2A%2AHumanities%2A%2A&field_graduate_course_type_tid=5356)\nYou will have access to an immense range of research material, including digital resources. These resources are provided through Oxford\u2019s impressive library system, based on the central Bodleian libraries, through the work produced by the University's research projects, and through the rich and diverse holdings of its museums.\nIn addition to materials and support focused on conveying subject-specific knowledge, there are a wide range of facilities aimed at the personal and professional development of students, strengthening their existing skills and developing new skills, and preparing them for careers after they have completed their studies.\n\">Video of Studying the Humanities\n[NextMathematical, Physical and Life Sciences](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department)[PreviousA-Z](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department)\n## Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences\nThe Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences (MPLS) Division is home to some of the most creative and innovative scientific thinkers and leaders working in academe. Senior researchers in MPLS at Oxford have been awarded some of the most significant scientific honours and the division has a strong tradition of attracting and nurturing the very best early career researchers who regularly secure prestigious fellowships.\nThe [division\u2019s nine departments and interdisciplinary doctoral training centre](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department?division=mpls) span the full spectrum of the mathematical, computational, physical, engineering and life sciences, and undertake both fundamental research and cutting-edge applied work. The division's four year doctoral training programmes are preparing a new generation of scientists to undertake quantitative and predictive research at the interface between the mathematical and physical, and the biological and medical sciences. They were established with funding from the following UK Research Councils:\n  * Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC);\n  * Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); and\n  * Medical Research Council (MRC)\n\n\nThe disciplines within the MPLS Division regularly appear at the highest levels in world rankings and have been evaluated as conducting world-leading and internationally excellent research in UK research assessments. We have extensive links with other leading universities, research institutes, public sector bodies, business and industry, in the UK and abroad.\n[View all courses](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing?keywords=%2A%2AMPLS%2A%2A) [View taught courses](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing?keywords=%2A%2AMPLS%2A%2A&field_graduate_course_type_tid=5359) [View research courses](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-a-z-listing?keywords=%2A%2AMPLS%2A%2A&field_graduate_course_type_tid=5356)\nTeaching is a major part of the division\u2019s activities and a number of highly rated taught master\u2019s courses are offered. For research students, a range of courses are available and the division is developing further cross-disciplinary provision for key research skills. Research at the interface between disciplines is strongly encouraged, both within the mathematical, life and physical sciences, and within the medical and environmental sciences. MPLS graduates are much in demand from academia, business and industry, government and the professions.\n\">Video of Graduate Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences at Oxford\n[NextMedical Sciences](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department)[PreviousHumanities](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department)\n## Medical Sciences\nThe Medical Sciences Division houses some of the strongest biomedical research in the world; Oxford is repeatedly placed first in clinical, pre-clinical and health in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.\nThe [Medical Sciences Division\u2019s departments and institutes](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/courses-by-department?division=medicalsciences) in Oxford and overseas are home to some of the strongest biomedical research in the world, regularly appearing at the highest levels in world rankings and rated world-leading and internationally excellent.\nThe Medical Sciences Division\u2019s 2,000 researchers cover a wide range of research, from atomic-resolution molecular structural biology to epidemiology as applied to very large populations. This enables students to work on virtually any biomedical problem. The division provides a stimulating and challenging environment for more than 2,000 talented graduate students with excellent new facilities and close personal supervision by world-class researchers.
